Note that all fields accept typical mathematical operations in python and NumPy such as `+` `-` `*` `/` `sqrt` `log` and all valid NumPy functions `func` can be called via `np.func()`. 

1. **Number of lattices** (moiré, CDW, superlattice) and **Moiré model** (Simple, Log)
    - Choose to simulate a 1, 2 or 3 layer lattice
       - Lattice 1 parameters change the single/first layer.
       - Lattice 2 only works if bilayer/trilayer are selected. These change the second lattice.
       - Lattice 3 only works if trilayer is selected. These change the third lattice.
   - Choose the model to simulate the moiré/CDW/superlattice
       - `Simple`: This minimal toy model approximates the moiré image, $T_M$, as the weighted sum between the sum of the individual lattices, $\sum_l Z_l$, and the product of the lattices, $\prod_l Z_l$ and is given by $T_M \propto (1-\eta)\sum_l Z_l + \eta\prod_L Z_l$. This toy model provides a good match to experimental STM images and offers a wide image contrast. However, the Fourier transforms -- by design -- contains only the first order atomic Bragg and moiré lattice peaks. The image is normalized such that $0\leq T_M \leq 1$.
           - `eta`, $\eta$ : A phenomenological parameter we use to weigh the relative strength of the sum of lattices, $\sum_l Z_l$, to the product of lattices, $\prod_L Z_l$. $\eta$ is a real number between 0 and 1: The moiré/superlattice image for $\eta=0$ purely the sum and $\eta=1$ is purely the product.
       - `Log`: This model, described by Joucken *et al* (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.11.030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> *Carbon* **83**, 48 (2015). </a>) is rooted in the constant-current tunneling process and takes into account the distance of the multilayers to the STM tip. The moiré/superlattice image, $T_M^L$, is approximated as $T_M^L \propto \ln|Z_1 + Z_2 e^{-\xi}|$ (bilayer) or $T_M^L \propto \ln|Z_1 + Z_2 e^{-\xi} + Z_3 e^{-2\xi}|$ (trilayer). This model provides a good match to both experimental STM images and their Fourier transforms, at the cost of limited image contrast.
           - `xi`, $\xi$ : The ratio of the inter-layer distance, $d$, and out-of-plane wavefunction decay length, $\lambda$: $\xi = d/\lambda$. $\xi$ is a real number between 0 and 10: For $\xi=0$, the intensity of the lattices is maximized; for $\xi$ = 10, only the top lattice, $Z_1$, is imaged.            

2. Image parameters
    - `Real resolution`: Current spatial resolution, defined as L/pix, in units of nm/pix.
    - `K-space resolution`: Current spatial resolution in reciprocal space, defined as 2π/L, in units of nm⁻¹/pix.
    - `Pixels`: number of pixels. Must be an integer or a mathematical expression of integers.
    - `Image length, L`: length of the image window in nanometers. Must be a real number or a mathematical expression of real numbers.
    - `Scan angle, θ`: Rotation (counter-clockwise) of the atomic lattice. Must be a real number or a mathematical expression of real numbers.
    - `Image offset`: Location of center of image. Must be a pair of real numbers, or a mathematical expression of real numbers, separated by a comma, e.g. -1.2,4.5.

3. Colormap
    -  `Real space image`: colormap of the real space simulated atomic lattice.
    -  `FFT`: colormap of the 2D fast Fourier transform.
    
4. Low pass filtering
    - `Gaussian width, σ`: radius of a Gaussian mask in real space in units of pixels. The half-width at half-max of the gaussian is shown as a white circle in the bottom left corner of the image.
    - The radius of the gaussian mask in nanometers is shown in the text box.

5. Save files
    - Click to save the files to a specific directory.
      - Clicking will open the file explorer.
      - Navigate to the directory you want to save the files in
      - Input a `filename` to save as
    - It will save a folder called `filename` with 4 files:
      - .png images of the real space and FFT, .txt file of the real space image, .txt file of the parameter values
      - `filename.png`, `filename_FFT.png`, `filename.txt`, `filename_params.txt`
      - Example of folder with saved files:

6. SPM image time estimator
    - `Tip velocity`: Velocity of the tip, $v_t$ across 1 line in nanometers/second. The total image time is calculated by considering the total pixels, scanning left/right and in a single slow-scan direction (upwards, for example). This time is estimated via $T_{im} = (2 * N_{pix} * L) / v_t$, where $N_{pix}$ is the number of pixels in the image, $L$ is the length of the image in nanometers, and the factor 2 takes into account the left/right fast-scan direction. 
    
7. Spectroscopy map Time estimator
    - `Time per spectra`: Total time in seconds (including overhead) to record a single spectrum, $T_{spec}$ i.e. one dI/dV(V) sweep. We assume that spectra are recorded in one direction along both the fast- and slow-scan direction. The time is estimated via $T_{map} = N_{pix}^2 * T_{spec} + (2 * N_{pix} * L) / v_t$.

8. Lattices
    - Parameters tab
       - `symmetry`: Choose to simulate either a triangular/hexagonal or square lattice.
       - `Lattice constant`: periodicity/spacing between atoms in nanometers.
       - `Twist angle`: twists the second lattice with respect to the first lattice (in Lattice 2 params) // twists the third lattice with respect to the second lattice (in Lattice 3 params)

    - Sublattices tab -- only affects hexagonal (triangular/honeycomb) lattices
       - Lattice site at the image `origin`: choose whether the `origin` should be a hollow site, an A-site atom or a B-site atom
          - To test this, set `L = 1` and click the different options for the origin
          <img width="400" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-03 at 4 26 18 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62832051/193703355-855b46de-f020-428f-af81-0ae4fee0bf57.png">

          
      - Weight of sublattices:
          - `alpha1`, $\alpha_1$ : weight of A sublattice
          - `beta1`, $\beta_1$: weight of B sublattice 
      - For a triangular lattice: `alpha = 1`, `beta = 0`

    - Strain tab
        - Apply the 2D strain tensor, $e_{xy}$, where the $x$-axis is defined as the *local* direction of that lattice, i.e. the strain tensor rotates with the local axes set by `theta` or `twist angle`. See https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.045401.
